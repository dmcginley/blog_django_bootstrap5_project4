## Files & classes ???

## Color Choices

Using the 60, 30, 10 Color Rule so not to overwhelm the user with too much color that would distract for the text in each post.

![image of the color rule 60 purple, 30 blue gray, 10 gray](readme_images/color_chart.png)





## Accessibility

* clean minimal design with use of white-space
* contrasting colors e.g. a lighter blue on the dark background of the code box in a post
* alternative text to images and buttons
* All elements the page are tab friendly 

## Testing
User testing, lighthouse from Chrome..... 

### Validator Testing

### Manual Testing
Creating multiple posts and comments bot editing them and deleting them to check the robust nature of the site.

## Error Handling

## Troubleshooting

profile pick was showing an error......

database broke during the creation of new tables while doing migrations, nothing fixed the error to resolve the issue. As I was only in the testing stage I deleted the database and reinitialized a new database.

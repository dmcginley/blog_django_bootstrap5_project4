## Color Choices

Using the 60, 30, 10 Color Rule so not to overwhelm the user with too much color that would distract for the text in each post.

## Testing

### Validator Testing

### Manual Testing
Creating multiple posts and comments bot editing them and deleting them to check the robust nature of the site.

## Error Handling

## Troubleshooting

profile pick was showing an error......

database broke during the creation of new tables while doing migrations, nothing fixed the error to resolve the issue. As I was only in the testing stage I deleted the database and reinitialized a new database.
